## Usage

`/create-branch-ado` or `/cb-ado` without any argument will create a branch with the naming scheme `users/<github handle>/<issue number>-<issue title>` off of default branch `main`.

Additional parameters can be passed to customize the branch:

### Username

Appending `username <username>` after `/create-branch-ado` or `/cb-ado` will allow you to customize what you would like to have following `users/` in the branch name.

For example, the command:
```sh
/create-branch-ado username jdoe  
```
would create the the following branch name:

```sh
users/jdoe/<issue number>-<issue title>
```
